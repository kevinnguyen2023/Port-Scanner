# Port-Scanner
Implemented a script that performs TCP and UDP port scanning that identifies statuses of transport layer ports in Python. In TCP scanning, the program scans a range of ports from given target IP addresses through a feature stealth scanning. For UDP scanning, valid application layer messages are added to UDP packets to identify queries on open ports.
